<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Project Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/GiantSweetroll/My-Family-Ledger)

This is a group project made by [Bryan Putra](https://github.com/BryanPutra), [Christy Natalia](https://github.com/christynatalia), [Gardyan Akbar](https://github.com/GiantSweetroll), and [Jocelyn Thiojaya](https://github.com/jocelynthiojaya) for our Database Systems course. This app uses MySQL to record, keep track, and manage finances within households. The idea behind the app is how sometimes the head of the family needs to give funds to the house staff (maids, drivers, etc.) to buy things needed for the house. Transactions used with that money is usually recorded in a ledger book by hand. Our aim is to simplify the process by making it digital and provide information to the head of the family so they can monitor and make sure that their money is used accordingly and appropriately. As such, the app allows the users to use the app as an admin or as a standard user, where admins can record the money they give to a particular user, and the user can record transactions used by the money they received. Here are the key featues of the app:
- Admin and User versions.
- Admins can transfer funds to the users in their group and see the transaction history of their users. A report is also generated for them to be able to see the total debit and credit of their funds and how they are used by their users.
- Users can input their transaction and see a history of their transactions.
